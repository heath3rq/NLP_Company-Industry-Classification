Our Mission: Improve the quality of health care.
Our Vision: Better health care. Better choices. Better health.

Points the way to health care that science says works.
Studies how well health plans and doctors provide scientifically recommended care.
Identifies organizations that are run in ways that make care better.

OUR WORK:
Saves thousands of lives.
Helps millions of people stay healthy.
Saves the country billions of dollars.

The NCQA seal is a widely recognized symbol of quality. Organizations incorporating the seal into advertising and marketing materials must first pass a rigorous, comprehensive review and must annually report on their performance. 

NCQA’s programs and services reflect a straightforward formula for improvement: Measure. Analyze. Improve. Repeat. NCQA makes this process possible in health care by developing quality standards and performance measures for a broad range of health care entities. 

NCQA’s contribution to the health care system is measured through statistics that track the quality of care delivered by the nation’s health plans. Every year for the past five years, these numbers have improved; health care protocols have been refined, doctors have learned new ways to practice, and patients have become more engaged in their care. Those improvements in quality care translate into lives saved, illnesses avoided and costs reduced. 

NCQA consistently raises the bar. Accredited health plans today face a rigorous set of standards and must report on their performance in more than 40 areas in order to earn NCQA’s seal of approval. These standards promote the adoption of strategies that we believe will improve care, enhance service and reduce costs.",Hospitals and Health Care

TailorMed,"TailorMed has the largest network of patients, providers, pharmacies and life science companies to ensure all patients across all medical conditions can access and afford treatment. 
 
Affordability is the leading driver behind care avoidance and therapy non-adherence. When patients cannot afford the care they need, when they need it, the impact is costly for the entire care network:
- For patients, their disease progresses, care events and therapies grow more complex, adherence becomes a struggle, and their overall well-being is impacted.
- For providers, waste and bad debt go up, service line and financial performance go down, and the patient experience suffers.
- For pharmacies, drug abandonment increases, and the ability to help patients access and adhere to therapies declines.

There is a better way. TailorMed’s comprehensive platform proactively identifies financially at-risk patients, matches them to relevant financial resources, and automates enrollment and ongoing program management.

Today, there are one hundred million people who are visually impaired due to cataract. Seventeen million people are blind and eighty-three million are moderate to severely visually impaired. Ninety percent of this vision loss is treatable through cataract surgery to alleviate the vast majority of vision loss. Unfortunately, there are not enough surgeons to perform cataract surgeries in the poorest regions in the world with the highest rates of vision loss, namely, Africa, China, India, and Latin America. The number of people with cataract that need surgery outnumbers the surgeons needed to perform the surgeries, a number that will continue to grow exponentially. 

On average, it takes four to eight years for cataract surgeons to achieve competency. Our solution uses eye surgery simulation-based training to significantly shorten the time it takes for eye surgeons to build competency and perform live surgeries.

We understand the complexity and large-scale change needed to reach these marginalized populations, but we cannot achieve this mission alone. HelpMeSee is building a sustainable model with partners and placing training centers in each of the poorest regions with the highest rates of vision loss to make the largest impact on this issue.",Hospitals and Health Care

It provides advice to its 190 member countries, encouraging them to adopt policies that foster economic stability, reduce their vulnerability to economic and financial crises, and raise living standards. The IMF also serves as a forum where its global membership can discuss the national, regional, and global consequences of their policies.


The IMF makes financing temporarily available to member countries to help them address balance of payments problemsthat is, when they find themselves short of foreign exchange to meet their payments to other countries.


Finally, the IMF provides countries with training to help them build the expertise and institutions they need for economic stability and growth. Supporting all of these activities is the institution's work in economic research and statistics.",Financial Services

United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF),"The UN Capital Development Fund makes public and private finance work for the poor in the worlds 46 least developed countries (#LDCs).


With its capital mandate and instruments, UNCDF offers last mile finance models that unlock public and private resources, especially at the domestic level, to reduce poverty and support local economic development. This last mile is where available resources for development are scarcest; where market failures are most pronounced; and where benefits from national growth tend to leave people excluded. 


UNCDFs financing models work through two channels: savings-led financial inclusion that expands the opportunities for individuals, households, and small businesses to participate in the local economy, providing them with the tools they need to climb out of poverty and manage their financial lives; and by showing how localized investments -- through fiscal decentralization, innovative municipal finance, and structured project finance -- can drive public and private funding that underpins local economic expansion and sustainable development. UNCDF financing models are applied in thematic areas where addressing barriers to finance at the local level can have a transformational effect for poor and excluded people and communities. 


By strengthening how finance works for poor people at the household, small enterprise, and local infrastructure levels, UNCDF contributes to SDG 1 on eradicating poverty with a focus on reaching the last mile and addressing exclusion and inequalities of access. At the same time, UNCDF deploys its capital finance mandate in line with SDG 17 on the means of implementation, to unlock public and private finance for the poor at the local level. By identifying those market segments where innovative financing models can have transformational impact in helping to reach the last mile, UNCDF contributes to a number of different SDGs and currently to 28 of 169 targets.",Financial Services

The CRE syndicator working overtime to deliver to their shareholders
The commercial developer striving to launch a community project
The investment fund manager stewarding every dollar with honesty

Highview National Insurance Company,"There are beliefs about Insurance Companies that don't apply to Highview National Insurance Company.


Some insurance companies,
_ Inflate how much a claim will cost _ the higher your loss experience the higher your policy cost is.
_ Dont invite risk managers to partner with them _ making it difficult to keep costs down.
_ Dont properly investigate claims _ resulting in costly mistakes.


Highview National Insurance Company works to counter this claim.
_ Its not about fighting the claim, its about managing it well.


Our mission is to provide coverage that benefits the insured.


This is how its done:


__ Customizing insurance policies.
__ Strategizing on minimizing risk exposure.
__ Adapting to the fast-changing marketplace.
__ Educating employers in proper safety protocols.
__ Collaborating effectively with our clients.
__ Identifying fraudulent claims.
__ Managing authentic claims.


The least expensive claim is a prevented claim. That is the goal of Highview National Insurance Co. - Made possible with our guidance and support


However, claims happen. For best results, we manage all aspects lowering your cost.




Looking for an insurance carrier that backs the policy sold to you?
Highview National Insurance Company perfectly matches that description.


What drives us?


Decades of experience in risk management and brokering workers compensation policies.
Being constantly let down by carriers solely interested in selling policies without the insureds best interest in mind.

While many admitted insurers risk appetites ebb and flow in tandem and find themselves chasing the same risks based on price, UFCICs target is that overlooked small well managed business that is stable, has consistent operations, has proven concern with risk management, a demonstrated ability to finance and maintain its operations, and has management and ownership with experience and quality of character.

How we are different:


We are a privately-owned firm, with a majority of the firm owned by employees. This enables us to take a long view in how we manage the firm, rather than the quarter-to-quarter approach of large, publicly-traded Wall Street firms. As the financial crises of 2008 showed, the interests of large Wall Street firms are often at odds with those of their clients.


We serve all our clients in a fiduciary capacity. We always have and always will put the interest of our clients ahead of our own. We will always operate in a fully transparent manner, disclosing all fees. Unlike the brokerage firm structure, we work for you, our client, and we are only compensated by you. We receive no fee or commission from any providers or funds we may recommend.


A sound financial plan is the foundation of a successful and secure financial future. Wealth management is far more involved than merely managing money. Our combined talents and expertise enable us to provide comprehensive, holistic and objective counsel and guidance to the multitude of issues that surround building and monitoring a financial plan that will change as your life changes.
